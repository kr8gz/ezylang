hello and welcme to my readme
# ooj fat makrdown

so anyway to use this pile of garbage

first of all you need to hav epython on your computer

this sounds like virus but it isnt it is just another programming language

ok now after you are done with setup you will make your first program with my languag

it will be a hello world

first you create a folder where you want to work with this langauge

then inside it you put the `ezy` file

this is the file that compiles and runs your ugly code

dont ever touch it

then createa file called `helloworld.ezy`

inside that file you copy paste this code (i am good teacher)

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

simple right

then go to cmd

and type `py ezy run helloworld`

this will run helloworld with ezy and run ezy with python because thats what i used

in your cmd you should then see the words hello and world

ok thats all youre getting from me

good luck
